```

The API that EpsteOut connects to has recently required an API key to access it. Keys are available for free at https://epstein.dugganusa.com/register.html

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--connections`, `-c` | Path to LinkedIn Connections.csv export (required) |
| `--output`, `-o` | Output HTML file path (default: `EpsteOut.html`) |

### Examples

Basic usage:
```bash
python EpsteOut.py --connections ~/Downloads/Connections.csv
```

Custom output file:
```bash
python EpsteOut.py --connections ~/Downloads/Connections.csv --output my_report.html
```

## Reading the Output

The script generates an HTML report (`EpsteOut.html` by default) that you can open in any web browser.

![A screenshot of the HTML report.](assets/screenshot.png)

The report contains:

- **Summary**: Total contacts searched and how many had mentions
- **Contact cards**: Each contact with mentions is displayed as a card showing:
  - Name, position, and company
  - Total number of mentions across all documents
  - Excerpts from each matching document
  - Links to the source PDFs on justice.gov

Contacts are sorted by number of mentions (highest first).

## Notes

- The search uses exact phrase matching on full names, so "John Smith" won't match documents that only contain "John" or "Smith" separately.
- Common names may produce false positives; review the context excerpts to verify relevance.
